### Network Defense Essentials

Every line in this repository were collected from the official EC Council course which covers all the essential contents that anticipate the NDE test. 

I will particularly be using these contents as a way to review the knowledge I already have, filling in some gaps that I ended up skipping during my professional development.

The content was separated by the EC Council into 12 different modules:
1. [Network Security Fundamentals](./1.%20Network%20Security%20Fundamentals)
2. [Identification, Authentication, and Authorization](./2.%20Identification%2C%20Authentication%2C%20and%20Authorization)
3. [Network Security Controls: Administrative Controls](./3.%20Network%20Security%20Controls%20-%20Administrative%20Controls)
4. [Network Security Controls: Physical Controls](./4.%20Network%20Security%20Controls%20-%20Physical%20Controls)
5. [Network Security Controls: Technical Controls](./5.%20Network%20Security%20Controls%20-%20Technical%20Controls)
6. [Virtualization and Cloud Computing](./6.%20Virtualization%20and%20Cloud%20Computing)
7. [Wireless Network Security](./7.%20Wireless%20Network%20Security)
8. [Mobile Device Security](./8.%20Mobile%20Device%20Security)
9. [IoT Device Security](./9.%20IoT%20Device%20Security)
10. [Cryptography and the Public Key Infrastructure](./10.%20Cryptography%20and%20the%20Public%20Key%20Infrastructure)
