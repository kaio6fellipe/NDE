# Network Defender Essencials
Every line in this repository were collected from the official EC Council course which covers all the essential contents that anticipate the NDE test. 

I will particularly be using these contents as a way to review the knowledge I already have, filling in some gaps that I ended up skipping during my professional development.

The content was separated by the EC Council into 12 different modules:
- Network Security Fundamentals
- Identification, Authentication, and Authorization
- Network Security Controls: Administrative Controls
- Network Security Controls: Physical Controls
- Network Security Controls: Technical Controls
- Virtualization and Cloud Computing
- Mobile Device Security
- IoT Device Security
- Cryptography and the Public Key Infrastructure
- Data Security
- Network Traffic Monitoring
