# Network Defender Essencials
Every line in this repository were collected from the official EC Council course which covers all the essential contents that anticipate the NDE test. 

I will particularly be using these contents as a way to review the knowledge I already have, filling in some gaps that I ended up skipping during my professional development.

The content was separated by the EC Council into 12 different modules:
1. Network Security Fundamentals
2. Identification, Authentication, and Authorization
3. Network Security Controls: Administrative Controls
4. Network Security Controls: Physical Controls
5. Network Security Controls: Technical Controls
6. Virtualization and Cloud Computing
7. Wireless Network Security
8. Mobile Device Security
9. IoT Device Security
10. Cryptography and the Public Key Infrastructure
11. Data Security
12. Network Traffic Monitoring
